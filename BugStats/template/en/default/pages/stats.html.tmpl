   <p> BugStats is a Bugzilla Extension for gethering statistics about user's activity in Bugzilla. 
       <li>These statistics measure how active a person was in Bugzilla </li>
       <li>Help users determine 'who is this guy' when looking at bug reports and comments</li>
   </p>
   <p> Dashboard for this guy:
	<li> what bugs he has reported</li>
	<li> what bugs he has been assigned</li>
	<li> what patches he has summitted</li>
	<li> what comments he has had</li>
	<li> what bugs he has voted</li>
	<li> what bugs he has CC</li>
   </p> 
   
  <p>
   Currently, we use the following formula to calculate a point for this guy:  
   <blockquote>
   point = log(#bugs_reported + 1) + log(#bugs_assigned+ 1)  + 3*log(#patch + 1) + log(#comment)/log(10) + log(#voting+ 1)/log(10)+ log(#cc + 1)/log(10) 
   </blockquote>
